## Tribeforce application version 2

### Software outline:

TF2 is a web application centered around the detection and use of personal talents in formal organisations, like companies, schools, etc... People create profiles that contain their talents. They can invite others to provide suggestions of new talents and feedback on existing ones.

People can set goals to develop the talents they choose to develop and ask feedback from a selective group of their contacts in how to do this most effectively. Once a goal is defined, it can be coupled with an opportunity that can be sourced from within the organisation, by anyone. A goal in combination with opportunity provides possibility for an engagement between the representative of the organisation and the individual (employer - employee, student - teacher, non-profit - volunteer, etc...). 

The progress of the engagement and it’s effect on the individual's talent and the organisations ‘opportunity’ are reported on in the application, and is then used to provide feedback and foster evolution. 

Use case:
TF2 is best suited for use within progressive organisations that foster personal growth and happiness and allow the end user (individual) total control over their data, even if they choose to quit collaboration with the formal organisation. 

## Technology:

TF2 is designed to run on a LAMP stack and makes use of Laravel 4, Zurb Foundation and JQuery 2.0 technologies. A functional version is currently online. Access can be gained by simple request to stijn@tribeforce.com


## Current status:
The software is not complete. A dev version is running in a single server environment, yet contains many bugs and incomplete elements. The backend is quite elaborately developed, the front end is still very rudimentary and needs some love.

We are actively looking for collaboration on this piece of software.
